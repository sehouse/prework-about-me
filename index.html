      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a 2014 graduate from the University of Michigan,
         with degrees in Political Science and History. After 
         graduation, I spent 5 years teaching elementary literacy.
         Last January, I went back to school to work on a degree 
         in Computer and Electrical Engineering, but had to leave
         the program to care for a family member.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Sanford, ME</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Building Gunpla models, playing the occasional video game,
         reading, watching Joshi puroresu.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Owner of a Joshi puroresu company in the Sasebo region of Japan.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Sanford, ME</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Even though I had to leave the engineering program that I
         was enrolled in, I still have a love and enjoyment of
         programming and working with computers.</p>
